        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Stuck with the same color combinations? Too afraid to use anything other than black and white? Don’t worry! Coliterator is a  completely random color generator that allows you to find and explore color combinations that you may have not thought about or seen before. It is for artists and designers who are looking for new and exciting combinations to include in their work. Coliterator was designed by taking into consideration the needs of  visual artists such as graphic designers by displaying the color combinations in different forms: blocks, gradients, typography and shapes. This way you can better visualize what the color combination could look like in your design.</p>
        <p>Coliterator is an independent project and currently a beta version as it is in the beginning of its journey: bugs may occur. Contact us to inform us about those faults or if you have ideas for improvements. </p>
